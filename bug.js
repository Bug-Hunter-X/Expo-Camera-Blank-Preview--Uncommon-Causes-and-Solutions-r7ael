This error typically occurs when using Expo's `Camera` API and manifests as a blank preview screen or an inability to capture images or videos.  It often stems from incorrect permission handling, conflicts with other libraries, or issues with the camera hardware itself. The error message isn't always explicit, making debugging challenging.  An example of problematic code would be a Camera component without properly requested permissions or within a component that unmounts before permissions are fully granted or denied.  This is a very common error in expo camera. Here's an example of the code causing the error:
```javascript
import { Camera, useCameraDevices } from 'expo-camera';

function App() {
  const devices = useCameraDevices();
  const [hasPermission, setHasPermission] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    (async () => {
      const { status } = await Camera.requestCameraPermissionsAsync();
      setHasPermission(status === 'granted');
    })();
  }, []);

  if (hasPermission === null) {
    return <View />; // Loading
  }
  if (hasPermission === false) {
    return <Text>No access to camera</Text>;
  }

  return (
    <Camera style={StyleSheet.absoluteFill} type={Camera.Constants.Type.back}>
      {/* Camera preview */}
    </Camera>
  );
}
```
