# Expo Camera Blank Preview: Uncommon Causes and Solutions

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue in Expo's Camera API: a blank preview screen. While permission issues are common, this focuses on less frequent causes and their solutions.

## Problem

The Expo Camera component shows a blank preview.  Standard permission checks appear correct, yet the camera remains unresponsive.

## Uncommon Causes

* **Library Conflicts:** Certain libraries might interfere with the Camera API's functionality.  This is particularly true if those libraries also access camera resources. 
* **Hardware Issues (Emulator):**  Emulators sometimes have problems with camera simulation.  Testing on a physical device is essential for ruling this out.
* **Asynchronous Operations:** Improper handling of asynchronous camera operations can lead to race conditions, resulting in a blank preview.  Permissions might be requested, but the camera isn't properly initialized by the time the component renders.
* **Incorrect Camera Type:** Specifying an unsupported or unavailable camera type can result in a blank preview. Double check that Camera.Constants.Type.back and Camera.Constants.Type.front are accessible on your device.

## Solutions

* **Isolate Libraries:** Try removing other libraries temporarily to identify potential conflicts.
* **Physical Device Testing:**  Test on a real device to rule out emulator problems.
* **Asynchronous Handling:** Ensure all Camera API calls are properly handled asynchronously using promises or async/await.
* **Explicit Camera Type:** Use `Camera.Constants.Type.back` or `Camera.Constants.Type.front` and verify these types are available on the device.
* **Check for Errors:** Implement comprehensive error handling to catch any exceptions during camera initialization or usage.

## Reproduction

The `bug.js` file contains example code that might exhibit the blank preview issue (though the exact circumstances can be varied and device specific).  The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates how to mitigate potential issues, focusing on asynchronous handling and comprehensive error handling.
